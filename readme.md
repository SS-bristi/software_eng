## Project Proposal: Waste Food Management and Donation System for NGOs & Restaurants*

### Applied Agile model (Software Development Life Cycle model):

Using the Agile method for Waste Food Management and Donation for NGOs and
Restaurants is highly beneficial due to the dynamic and evolving nature of the food industry
and social initiatives. Agile methodologies, characterized by flexibility, iterative development,
and constant collaboration, align well with the unpredictable challenges in food management
and donation processes. By employing Agile, teams can quickly adapt to changing
regulations, donor preferences, and food safety standards, ensuring that the system remains
responsive to emerging needs. Additionally, Agile's incremental approach allows for
continuous improvement, enabling stakeholders to incorporate feedback and make
adjustments in real-time, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and impact of food waste
reduction initiatives.

As per the knowledge the technology is going advanced and growing day by day. Over main
motto is to help needy people. The idea behind over project can be use by many people who
wish to donate things to needy organizations Also, many organizations like to ask for various
things required by them such as clothes, food grains, books utensils. In this project, we have
tried to reduce food wastage by giving waste food to people or organization who need it. The
needy will add to a request, in case of any leftover food donor have. This request is sent to
the list of donors. The Available Donor then accept the request. We are going to manage the
delivery system by appointing delivery person who will collect the food from the donor and
distribute among the needy people. Second option for delivery system is that volunteers who
wish to help to donate food can join us for distribution in near by areas. For eg: they can
distribute food in government school, government hospital, orphanage, old age homes. And
the third option is the Food Bank if we receive food in odd times we can give it to food bank
where the care of food is taken. Safety and Hygiene are maintained in food banks. So. food
wastage or food spoilage cannot occur.

### *1. Introduction:*

- Monitor system performance and address any immediate concerns.

### 5. Stakeholders:*
- *Primary Users:*
- Restaurants (donors)
- NGOs (recipients)
- *Secondary Users:*
- System administrators
- Delivery personnel

### 6. Risk Management:*
- Identify potential risks such as data security concerns and address them proactively.
- Continuous monitoring and adaptation to changes during the development process.

### 7. Budget and Timeline:*
- Allocate resources effectively within a defined budget and timeline.
- Regularly assess progress to ensure adherence to the project schedule.

### 8. Conclusion:*- The Waste Food Management and Donation project, utilizing agile methodologies, aims
to create a sustainable platform connecting restaurants and NGOs seamlessly. The iterative
approach allows for continuous improvement, ensuring the solution meets the evolving
needs of all stakeholders.

Note: Adjust phases and sprints based on project complexity and requirements.
